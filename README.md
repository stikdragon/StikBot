StikBot
=======

StikBot, mostly made for playing Dominion over IRC.  Suffers a little 
bit from flooding problems on occassion and has changed the game dynamics
somewhat due to running in an open channel where you can't easily keep 
the player's individual hands private.  Some cards just don't work well 
so it'll never be a complete copy.
